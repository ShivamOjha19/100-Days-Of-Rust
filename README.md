# 🦀 100 Days of Rust

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfRust** challenge — where I’ll be building **one Rust project every day** for the next 100 days! 🎯

The goal?  
To sharpen my systems programming skills, stay consistent, and build a strong technical foundation to solve real-world problems — especially in the **FinTech** space where performance and reliability matter most.

---

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

Every day, I’ll push a mini project built in Rust — from simple CLI tools to more complex experiments with data, networking, and maybe even blockchain mechanics.

Each project will include:
- ✅ Well-structured code
- 📝 A detailed write-up (linked to [my Medium](https://medium.com/@shivamojha2419))
- 📚 Learning notes and takeaways
- 📦 Use of modern Rust tooling and crates

---

## 🔥 Why This Challenge?

I believe that **consistency beats intensity**.  
This challenge is my way of:
- Staying committed to my growth as a developer.  
- Building my personal brand in the **technical side of finance**  
- Contributing back to the dev community through transparent learning

---

## 📖 Blog Series

Every day, I’ll publish a detailed blog post on Medium covering:
- What I built
- What I learned
- How you can follow along

## 💻 Code Repo

This GitHub repo is the home for all 100 projects.  
Each folder is named by day (`Day_1`, `Day_2`, ...) and includes:
- Source code
- README with explanations (where needed)
- Notes or references

## 🧠 Topics I Plan to Explore

Over the next 100 days, expect to see projects covering:
- 📊 Data structures & algorithms in Rust
- 💾 File I/O & serialization
- 🧵 Async & multithreading
- 🧮 Cryptography & zero-knowledge proofs
- 💸 FinTech utilities (price trackers, portfolio tools, simulations)
- 🌐 Web servers & APIs in Rust
- 🧱 WASM + Rust
- 🧪 Testing, benchmarking, and release-ready tooling
